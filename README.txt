Directions:
Coding
Create a multi pane app (add two fragment to the activity in a sequence)
Fragment one should have a list of celebrity names.
Fragment two should have the detail of the celebrity selected.


-Fragment two should be updated on each list item clicked
-Celebrity detail should have at least a picture of the celebrity (you can save all the images in the drawable folder), short description. But be creative to add more if you like.
-Use different attributes to make the design better.
